#A recreation of the Google homepage.

The Odin Project is a site where anyone can learn to be a web developer, and this repository hosts a project which came from that site. The project is to recreate the google homepage, with search box and nav bars. Nothing else is functional; i.e. links are dead and search bar doesn't search, but it's a good starting project.

##What I'm Using
-HTML
-CSS
